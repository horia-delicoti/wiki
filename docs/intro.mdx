Welcome to my personal knowledge wiki. A digital garden where I collect, organize, and share everything I learn about technology,
DevOps, programming, and beyond. This wiki is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/horia-delicoti/wiki).

Check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below to understand how navigate this wiki.

> **Why this wiki?**  
> I use this space as my digital brain: a place to document notes, guides, code snippets, and insights from my daily work and studies. Itâ€™s a living resource that grows as I do.

## Getting Started

- Browse the sidebar for topics and subtopics.
- Use the search bar (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>) to quickly find anything.
- Most pages are written in Markdown and updated regularly.
- Youâ€™ll find everything from quick commands to deep dives on tools, workflows, and best practices.

## How it works

All content is open source and versioned on [GitHub](https://github.com/horia-delicoti/wiki).  
Whenever I update or add a page, the site rebuilds and publishes automatically.

## Contributing & Feedback

If you spot a mistake or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/horia-delicoti/wiki/issues) or submit a pull request.  
I welcome feedback and contributions from anyone interested in learning and sharing knowledge.

Happy exploring! ðŸš€
