title: MDX
---

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX (React components) within Markdown documents. It enables developers and content creators to combine rich, interactive components with traditional Markdown content, making it ideal for documentation, blogs, and interactive tutorials.

---

## 🌟 Key Concepts

- **Markdown + JSX:** Write Markdown and embed React components directly in the same file.
- **Component Embedding:** Import and use custom or third-party React components inside your Markdown.
- **Interactivity:** Add dynamic, interactive UI elements to static content.
- **Ecosystem:** Works with tools like Next.js, Gatsby, and Storybook for building modern documentation and sites.

## 🛠️ Example

```mdx
# Hello, MDX!

This is a Markdown paragraph.

<Counter />

import Chart from './Chart'

<Chart data={[1,2,3]} />
```
