title: Programming Languages
---

Programming languages are formal systems designed to communicate instructions to computers. They enable developers to write software, automate tasks, analyze data, and build everything from web applications to operating systems. Each language has its own syntax, features, and ideal use cases.

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) teaches you everything you need to implement a scripting language.

## üåü Key Concepts

- **Syntax:** The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered valid in a language.
- **Compiled vs Interpreted:** Compiled languages (e.g., C, Go, Rust) are transformed into machine code before execution. Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) are executed line-by-line by an interpreter.
- **Static vs Dynamic Typing:** Static typing (e.g., Java, C++) requires variable types at compile time. Dynamic typing (e.g., Python, JavaScript) determines types at runtime.
- **Paradigms:** Common paradigms include procedural, object-oriented, functional, and declarative programming.

## üõ†Ô∏è Popular Programming Languages

- **Python:** Easy to learn, widely used for scripting, data science, web development, and automation.
- **JavaScript:** The language of the web, used for front-end and back-end development.
- **Java:** Popular for enterprise applications, Android development, and large systems.
- **C/C++:** Used for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
- **Go:** Designed for simplicity and concurrency, often used in cloud and backend services.
- **Rust:** Focuses on safety and performance, popular for systems programming.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript with static typing.
- **Ruby:** Known for its elegant syntax, used in web development (e.g., Ruby on Rails).
- **PHP:** Widely used for server-side web development.
- **Swift/Kotlin:** Modern languages for iOS and Android development, respectively.
