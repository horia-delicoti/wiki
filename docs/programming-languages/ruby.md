## 🌟 Key Concepts

- **Object-Oriented:** Everything in Ruby is an object, including primitive data types.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Types are determined at runtime, allowing for flexible and expressive code.
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory management.
- **Readable Syntax:** Designed to be intuitive and close to natural language.
- **Metaprogramming:** Ruby allows code to modify itself at runtime.
