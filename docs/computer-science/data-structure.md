Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are fundamental to computer science and are used in almost every software application.

## 🧩 Common Data Structures

- **Array:** A collection of elements identified by index.
- **Linked List:** A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.
- **Stack:** Last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue:** First-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Hash Table (Map):** Stores key-value pairs for fast lookup.
- **Tree:** Hierarchical structure with nodes (e.g., binary tree, AVL tree).
- **Graph:** Set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- **Heap:** Specialized tree-based structure for priority queues.
- **Trie:** Tree-like structure for storing strings, often used in search.
