Privacy is the right to control your personal information and decide how it is collected, used, and shared. In the digital age, protecting your privacy is essential to prevent identity theft, surveillance, targeted advertising, and data breaches.

### How to Check Your Data Online

- **Search for your email/username:** Use sites like [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to check if your email or passwords have been leaked.
- **Google yourself:** Search your name, email, and usernames to see what public information is available.
- **Check data brokers:** Look up your info on sites like [Spokeo](https://www.spokeo.com/), [Whitepages](https://www.whitepages.com/), [BeenVerified](https://www.beenverified.com/), and [MyLife](https://www.mylife.com/).
- **Social media privacy checkups:** Review privacy settings on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

### How to Delete Your Data

- **Delete accounts:** Use [JustDelete.me](https://justdelete.me/) for direct links and instructions to remove accounts from many services.
- **Opt out of data brokers:** Visit [OptOutPrescreen](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) (US), or use [Abine DeleteMe](https://joindeleteme.com/) for paid removal.
- **Request removal:** Many sites have privacy/contact forms to request data deletion (look for "privacy" or "contact us" pages).
- **Clear search history:** Regularly delete your search and location history from Google, YouTube, and other platforms.
