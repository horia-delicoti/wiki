The **World Wide Web** (WWW or simply "the web") is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and resources, accessed via the Internet using web browsers. It revolutionized information sharing, communication, and application delivery, and is now a core part of daily life and business.

## üï∞Ô∏è How the Web Appeared

The web was invented in 1989 by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) at CERN. He proposed a system for sharing information using hypertext, which led to the creation of the first web browser and server in 1990. The web rapidly grew after the release of the Mosaic browser in 1993, making the Internet accessible to the public.

## üåê Web Apps vs. Static Sites

- **Static Sites:**  
  Serve fixed content (HTML, CSS, images) that does not change unless the files are updated. Fast, secure, and easy to host (e.g., personal blogs, documentation).
  - Example: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

- **Web Apps:**  
  Interactive applications that run in the browser, often communicating with servers via APIs. Can update content dynamically without reloading the page.
  - Example: [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## üìè Web Standards

The web is built on open standards, ensuring interoperability and accessibility:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Structure of web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity and dynamic content.
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for communication.
- **Web APIs:** Browser interfaces for storage, graphics, networking, etc.
- **Accessibility (WCAG):** Guidelines for making the web usable by everyone.
- **W3C:** [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) ‚Äî main standards body.

## ‚ú® Amazing Things About the Web

- **Universal Access:** Anyone with an Internet connection can access the web.
- **Open Platform:** No single owner; anyone can publish and innovate.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Sites work on all devices, from basic to advanced.
- **WebAssembly:** Run high-performance code (C/C++, Rust) in the browser.
- **PWAs (Progressive Web Apps):** Installable, offline-capable web apps.
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebRTC enables video/audio chat in the browser.
- **3D Graphics:** WebGL and WebGPU bring advanced graphics to the web.
- **Global Collaboration:** The web powers open source, education, and remote work.
