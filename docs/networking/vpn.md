VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network, enhancing privacy and security.

I use [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) for my personal VPN needs. It's known for its simplicity, speed, and strong security features.
