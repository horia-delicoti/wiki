SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over the internet. SSL certificates are used to encrypt data between clients and servers, ensuring privacy, data integrity, and authentication for websites and online services.

## 🛡️ Why SSL/TLS Matters

- **Encryption:** Protects sensitive data (passwords, credit cards) from eavesdroppers.
- **Authentication:** Confirms the identity of websites and servers.
- **Data Integrity:** Prevents data from being tampered with during transmission.
- **Trust:** Browsers display a padlock for SSL-secured sites, increasing user confidence.

## 🛠️ Example OpenSSL Commands

```sh
# Generate a new private key
openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
```

```sh
# Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr
```

```sh
# Generate a self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key private.key -sha256 -days 365 -out certificate.crt
```

```sh
# View certificate details
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
```

```sh
# Convert PEM to PKCS#12 (for import into browsers or other systems)
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt
```

## 📝 Notes

- Always keep your private keys secure and never share them.
- Use strong key sizes (2048 bits or higher) for better security.
- Let's Encrypt offers free SSL certificates and automated renewal.
