title: Domains
---

A domain is a unique, human-readable address used to identify websites and services on the internet (e.g., `example.com`). Domains make it easy for users to access resources without needing to remember complex IP addresses. Managing domains involves registration, DNS configuration, and sometimes transferring or renewing ownership.

## 🛠️ DNS Management

DNS (Domain Name System) connects your domain name to the correct server or service. Providers like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) offer DNS management, security, and performance features.

## 🚀 Hosting Websites

Once you have a domain, you can point it to a hosting provider to serve your website or application. Popular hosting options include:

- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## 📝 Notes

- Domains must be renewed periodically to maintain ownership.
- Use DNSSEC and secure DNS providers to protect your domain from hijacking.
- Consider privacy protection services to hide your personal information in WHOIS records.
