A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are essential for storing information in applications, websites, and systems of all sizes.

## üß© Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases (SQL):** Store data in tables with rows and columns. Use Structured Query Language (SQL) for queries.
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
- **NoSQL Databases:** Designed for flexible, scalable storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.
  - Types: Document (MongoDB), Key-Value (Redis), Column (Cassandra), Graph (Neo4j)
- **In-Memory Databases:** Store data in RAM for fast access.
  - Examples: Redis, Memcached
- **Time Series Databases:** Optimized for time-stamped data.
  - Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

## üèÜ Why Use a Database?

- Efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data
- Ensure data consistency, integrity, and security
- Support concurrent access by multiple users
- Enable backup, recovery, and data management

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts

- **Table:** Structure for organizing data in rows and columns (relational).
- **Record/Row:** A single entry in a table.
- **Field/Column:** An attribute or property of the data.
- **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for a record.
- **Index:** Improves the speed of data retrieval.
- **Query:** Request for data or information from the database.
- **Transaction:** A sequence of operations performed as a single unit.

## üìù Notes

- Choose the right database type based on your application's needs (structure, scale, speed).
- Regularly back up your databases to prevent data loss.
- Understand ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for reliable transactions in relational databases.
