title: InfluxDB
----

InfluxDB is an open-source time series database designed for storing, querying, and analyzing large volumes of time-stamped data, such as metrics, events, and logs. It is widely used for monitoring, IoT, real-time analytics, and DevOps observability.

## üåü Key Features

- **Time Series Optimized:** Efficiently handles high write and query loads for time-stamped data.
- **Schema-less:** Flexible data model; measurements, tags, and fields can be added dynamically.
- **Powerful Query Language:** InfluxQL and Flux for querying and data transformation.
- **Retention Policies:** Automatically expire old data based on configurable policies.
- **Integrations:** Works with visualization tools like Grafana and Telegraf for data collection.

## üß© Use Cases

- Application and infrastructure monitoring
- IoT sensor data collection
- Real-time analytics dashboards
- DevOps observability and alerting

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Concepts

- **Measurement:** Similar to a table in relational databases.
- **Tag:** Indexed metadata for efficient queries (e.g., location, host).
- **Field:** Actual data values (e.g., temperature, CPU usage).
- **Timestamp:** Each data point is associated with a time.

## üìù Notes

- InfluxDB is ideal for high-frequency, time-stamped data.
- Use tags for metadata you‚Äôll query often; use fields for actual measurements.
- Retention policies help manage storage and data lifecycle.
