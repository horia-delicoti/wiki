[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. It is designed for reliability and scalability, making it a popular choice for monitoring modern cloud-native and containerized environments.

## üåü Key Features

- **Time Series Database:** Stores metrics as time series data, identified by metric name and key/value pairs.
- **Powerful Query Language (PromQL):** Enables flexible querying and aggregation of metrics.
- **Pull Model:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from instrumented targets at specified intervals.
- **Service Discovery:** Automatically discovers targets via integrations with Kubernetes, Consul, and more.
- **Alerting:** Integrated alert manager for sending notifications based on metric thresholds.
- **Visualization:** Built-in expression browser and integration with Grafana for dashboards.

## üß© Use Cases

- Infrastructure and application monitoring
- Container and Kubernetes monitoring
- Service-level objectives (SLOs) and alerting
- Real-time analytics and observability

## üõ†Ô∏è Ecosystem & Tools

- **Alertmanager:** Handles alerts sent by Prometheus server.
- **Grafana:** Popular dashboard tool for visualizing Prometheus data.
- **Sloth:** [Sloth](https://github.com/slok/sloth) helps define and manage SLOs with Prometheus.
- **Exporters:** Collect metrics from third-party systems (e.g., node_exporter, blackbox_exporter).
