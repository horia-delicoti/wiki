title: Cassandra
---

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It is widely used for applications that require scalability, fault tolerance, and fast write performance.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Distributed Architecture:** Data is distributed across multiple nodes for fault tolerance and scalability.
- **No Single Point of Failure:** Designed to remain available even if some nodes fail.
- **High Write Throughput:** Optimized for fast, large-scale write operations.
- **Eventual Consistency:** Uses a tunable consistency model for balancing performance and reliability.
- **Flexible Schema:** Supports dynamic addition of columns and tables.

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Real-time big data applications
- IoT platforms
- Messaging and recommendation systems
- Time-series data storage
- Applications requiring high availability and scalability

---

## 🛠️ Basic Concepts

- **Node:** A single machine in the Cassandra cluster.
- **Cluster:** A collection of nodes that store data together.
- **Keyspace:** The top-level namespace for tables (similar to a database in RDBMS).
- **Table (Column Family):** Stores data in rows and columns.
- **Partition Key:** Determines how data is distributed across nodes.
- **Replication:** Copies of data are stored on multiple nodes for fault tolerance.

## 📝 Notes

- Cassandra is best suited for write-heavy workloads and large-scale distributed systems.
- Data modeling in Cassandra is different from relational databases—design tables based on queries.
- Regularly monitor and tune your cluster for optimal performance.
