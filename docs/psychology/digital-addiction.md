### Introduction

Many large tech companies (Google, Meta, TikTok, etc.) do not charge users fees. Instead, they sell ads. They collect user data and use it to target ads for products and services they predict these users would most like to purchase. Their ad revenues increase when users spend more time online.

They invest millions in research and engineering to maximize user engagement on their platforms. They have been criticized for their data collection practices, algorithmic manipulation, Ads, and addictive features.

Key strategies include:

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Content loads endlessly, removing natural stopping points and making it easy to lose track of time.
- **Short-form Videos**: Platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram use very short videos (under 15 seconds) because research shows the average attention span is around 8 seconds.
- **Variable Rewards**: The unpredictability of what content will appear next keeps users engaged longer, similar to gambling mechanics.
- **Personalized Algorithms**: These algorithms analyze user behavior to suggest content that is likely to keep them watching, often leading to a "rabbit hole" effect.
- **Notifications**: Frequent alerts about new content encourage users to return to the platform, making it hard to stop.

These techniques can lead to "doomscrolling" or "binge-watching" which means endlessly consuming content, which can harm mental health, productivity, and focus due to constant dopamine spikes and reduced attention spans.
