title: Dotfiles
---

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files in your home directory (usually starting with a dot, e.g., `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`) that customize your Unix/Linux/macOS environment. Managing dotfiles allows you to personalize your shell, editor, tools, and workflows, and makes it easy to replicate your setup across machines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Managing Dotfiles

- **Version Control:** Store your dotfiles in a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository for backup and syncing.
