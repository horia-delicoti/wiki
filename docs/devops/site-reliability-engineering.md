[Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)](https://sre.google/) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create scalable and highly reliable software systems. SRE originated at Google and has since been adopted by many organizations to improve service reliability, performance, and efficiency.

> "Fundamentally, it's what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function." - Ben Treynor Sloss, VP Google Engineering, founder of Google SRE
