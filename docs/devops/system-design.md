title: System Design
---

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a critical skill for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems, especially at scale.

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Scalability:** Ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.
- **Reliability:** Ensuring the system works correctly and consistently over time.
- **Availability:** The proportion of time a system is operational and accessible.
- **Maintainability:** Ease of updating and improving the system.
- **Performance:** How quickly a system responds to requests.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring data remains accurate and synchronized across the system.
- **Partition Tolerance:** System‚Äôs ability to continue operating despite network partitions (see CAP theorem).

## üèóÔ∏è Common Components

- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- **Database:** Stores and manages data (SQL, NoSQL, caching).
- **Cache:** Temporarily stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.
- **Application Server:** Runs the core business logic.
- **Message Queue:** Enables asynchronous communication between services.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Delivers static content closer to users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:** Divide the system into distinct sections, each handling a specific responsibility.
- **Redundancy:** Duplicate critical components to prevent single points of failure.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more machines to handle increased load.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Increase resources (CPU, RAM) on existing machines.
- **Statelessness:** Design services so they don‚Äôt rely on local state, making scaling easier.

## üìù Notes

- System design interviews often focus on trade-offs and justifying your choices.
- Practice designing systems like URL shorteners, chat apps, and news feeds.
- Always consider requirements, constraints, and bottlenecks.
