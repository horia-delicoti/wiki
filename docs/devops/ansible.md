title: Ansible
---

Ansible is an open source automation platform that helps with configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses simple, human-readable YAML files (playbooks) to describe automation jobs, making it easy to manage infrastructure as code.

---

## üåü Key Features

- **Agentless:** No need to install agents on managed nodes; uses SSH.
- **Idempotent:** Ensures tasks produce the same result, even if run multiple times.
- **Extensible:** Supports modules for various tasks (e.g., package management, cloud provisioning).
- **Declarative:** Define the desired state of your systems.
- **Scalable:** Manage a few servers or thousands with the same approach.

## üöÄ Common Use Cases

- Server provisioning and configuration
- Application deployment
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
- Cloud resource orchestration
- Security automation and compliance

## ‚ö° Ad-Hoc Commands

Ad-hoc commands let you run simple tasks without writing a playbook. Examples:

```sh
# Ping all nodes (default inventory)
ansible all -m ping

# Ping all nodes (specify inventory)
ansible all -i "/vagrant/data/hosts" -m ping

# Gather facts
ansible -i inventory <hostname or hostgroup> -m setup

# Specify host and user
ansible ip-192-168-100-11.local -m ping -u vagrant

# Execute a shell command
ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"
ansible all -a "uptime"

# Use the shell module
ansible all -m shell -a "pwd"
ansible all -m shell -a 'echo $HOME'

# Update and upgrade packages (Debian/Ubuntu)
ansible all -m apt -a "update_cache=yes upgrade=dist" --become

# Install a package
ansible all -m apt -a "name=tree state=present" --become
```

## üìù Notes

- Ansible playbooks are written in YAML and describe the desired state of your infrastructure.
- Inventories define which hosts Ansible manages.
- Use roles and variables to organize complex automation tasks.
- Ansible is widely used in DevOps for its simplicity and power.
