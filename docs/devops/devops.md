## DevOps Wiki

DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and tools that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle, improve collaboration, and deliver high-quality software continuously. DevOps emphasizes automation, monitoring, and a culture of shared responsibility.

## üöÄ Key Concepts

- **Collaboration:** Breaks down silos between development and operations teams.
- **Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks such as testing, integration, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Frequently merging code changes and automatically testing them.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Automating the release of code to production or staging environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing infrastructure using code and automation tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Continuously tracking application and infrastructure health.
- **Scalability & Reliability:** Building systems that are resilient and can scale as needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Popular Tools

- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- **Containers:** Docker, Podman
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, Minikube
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Testing:** Selenium, Cypress
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
