[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a highly configurable, efficient, and powerful text editor built to enable fast text editing. It is an improved version of the classic vi editor, available on almost every Unix-like system. Vim is popular among developers and system administrators for its keyboard-driven workflow, extensibility, and support for scripting.
