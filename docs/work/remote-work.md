## üåü Key Concepts

- **Distributed Teams:** Teams with members working from different locations, sometimes across time zones and countries.
- **Remote-First vs. Remote-Friendly:**  
  - *Remote-First*: The default mode of work is remote, with processes and tools optimized for distributed teams.  
  - *Remote-Friendly*: Remote work is allowed, but the company may still prioritize in-office work.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Communication that does not require all participants to be present at the same time (e.g., email, chat, project management tools).
- **Synchronous Communication:** Real-time communication (e.g., video calls, phone calls, live chat).
