Life is the journey of existence, growth, and experience. It encompasses our relationships, achievements, challenges, and the search for meaning and happiness.
The purpose of life is a deeply personal and philosophical question. For some, it is about seeking happiness, meaning, and fulfillment; for others, it is about service, love, or the pursuit of knowledge.
