title: Cloud Computing
---

Cloud computing provides access to IT resources via the internet, allowing users to scale resources up or down as needed and pay only for what they use. It removes the need for owning and maintaining physical servers and data centers.

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud:** Services offered over the public internet by providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, offering more control and security.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## ‚≠ê Key Characteristics

- **On-demand self-service:** Provision resources as needed, automatically.
- **Broad network access:** Access services from anywhere via the internet.
- **Resource pooling:** Providers serve multiple customers with shared resources.
- **Rapid elasticity:** Scale resources up or down quickly.
- **Measured service:** Usage is monitored and billed accordingly.
