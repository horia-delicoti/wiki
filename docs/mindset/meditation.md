Meditation is a practice where an individual uses techniques—such as mindfulness, focused attention, or contemplation—to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear, emotionally calm, and stable state. Meditation has roots in many spiritual and philosophical traditions, but is also widely practiced today for its mental and physical health benefits.
