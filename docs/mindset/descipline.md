- **Delayed Gratification:** Prioritizing long-term rewards over short-term pleasure.
- **Self-Control:** Managing impulses and emotions to stay on track.

## 🏋️ Quotes from David Goggins

> “Motivation is crap. Motivation comes and goes. When you’re driven, whatever is in front of you will get destroyed.”  
> — David Goggins

> “You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft, that you will die without ever realizing your true potential.”  
> — David Goggins

> “The only way you gain mental toughness is to do things you’re not happy doing. If you continue doing things that you’re satisfied and make you feel good, you’re not getting stronger.”

## 🍪 The Cookie Jar Method

David Goggins’ “Cookie Jar” is a mental strategy for pushing through pain and adversity. The idea is to recall past victories, hardships overcome, and moments of strength—your “cookies”—when you face new challenges. By reaching into your “cookie jar,” you remind yourself of your resilience and capability.

> “In times of suffering, you forget how hard you really are. The Cookie Jar is a reminder of all the things you’ve overcome.”  
> — David Goggins

**How to use it:**

1. Write down your past achievements and moments of overcoming adversity.
2. When you’re struggling, mentally “reach into the jar” and remember those moments.
3. Use that memory as fuel to keep going.
