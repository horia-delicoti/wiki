## 🛠️ Strategies to Beat Procrastination

- **The 2-Minute Rule (David Allen):**  
  If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it's defined.
- **Atomic Habits Principle:**  
  A habit needs to be established before it can be expanded upon. Start with very small, manageable steps.
- **Break Tasks Down:**  
  Simplify big tasks into smaller, actionable steps.
- **Set Clear Goals:**  
  Define what needs to be done and why it matters.
- **Remove Distractions:**  
  Create a focused environment and limit interruptions.
- **Use Timers:**  
  Try techniques like Pomodoro (work for 25 minutes, then take a break).
