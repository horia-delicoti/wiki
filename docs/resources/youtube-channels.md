title: YouTube Channels
description: A list of YouTube channels that focus on educational content, technology, and DIY projects without falling into the trap of mindless scrolling.
---

Because of [Digital Addiction](/docs/psychology/digital-addiction), I want to be mindful of my time and use [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) as a tool for learning and personal growth but not as a source of mindless scrolling. I use [Focused Youtube Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/focused-youtube/) that removes video suggestions, sidebars, and comments.

Another way to avoid [doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) on Youtube is to turn history off from [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/) settings -> [Data & Privacy](https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy) -> YouTube History -> Pause. This way, Youtube won't be able to recommend videos based on your watch history.

Here are some channels that focus on educational content, technology, and DIY projects.
I also use [Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/) ([Web](https://invidious.io/)), [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) (desktop), or [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) (mobile app) to avoid using the official YouTube app.
