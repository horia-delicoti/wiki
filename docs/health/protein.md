| Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) | **1.3g/kg** of body weight | **91g** |
| Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) | **1.6g/kg** of body weight | **112g** |
| Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) | **1.8-2.0g/kg** of body weight | **126-140g** |
