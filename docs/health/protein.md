[Protein](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-does-protein-do-11771745) is an essential macronutrient that plays a crucial role in building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting overall health. It is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of life.

- Players need enough protein to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (build muscle), and also to repair muscle damage that occurs during training. Choosing lean, high-quality protein at meals, but also before and after every workout, is imperative for football players to optimize performance and recovery.

### Calculate Your Protein Needs

To calculate your daily protein needs, you can use the following formula based on your body weight and activity level:

| Activity Level | Protein Intake Recommendation | Total Daily Protein Intake / per 70kg (154 lbs) |
|----------------|-------------------------------| -------------------------------|
| Sedentary (little to no exercise) | **0.8g/kg** of body weight | **56g** |
| Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) | **1.0g/kg** of body weight | **70g** |
| Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) | **1.3g/kg** of body weight | **91g** |
| Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) | **1.6g/kg** of body weight | **112g** |
| Extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) | **1.8-2.0g/kg** of body weight | **126-140g** |

### Notes

- "Too much protein and too few carbohydrates may not be the healthiest plan. This kind of eating pattern has been linked to an increased risk of developing osteoporosis." - [Extra protein is a decent dietary choice, but don’t overdo it](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/extra-protein-is-a-decent-dietary-choice-but-dont-overdo-it-201305016145)
- "Digesting protein releases acids into the bloodstream, which the body usually neutralizes with calcium and other buffering agents. As a result, early research theorized that eating lots of protein requires a lot more calcium – which may be pulled from bone. A 2009 systematic review found that this doesn’t appear to happen" - [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)
