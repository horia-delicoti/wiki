[Creatine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17674-creatine) is a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in certain foods and synthesized in the human body. Is also created by the liver, kidneys, and pancreas from amino acids. It is stored primarily in muscle cells and used as a quick source of energy during high-intensity, short-duration activities such as weightlifting and sprinting.

### What is Creatine?

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound made in the **liver**, **kidneys**, and **pancreas** from three amino acids: [glycine](https://www.verywellhealth.com/glycine-overview-4583816), [arginine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/l-arginine#benefits), and [methionine](https://www.verywellhealth.com/methionine-4771763). Humans typically produce about 1 - 1.5 gram per day, and we obtain another gram from animal-based foods such as meat and fish.

### How does Creatine work?

Creatine works by increasing the availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy carrier in cells. During high-intensity exercise, ATP is rapidly depleted, and creatine helps replenish it, allowing for sustained performance.
