---

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It powers everything from smartphones and servers to supercomputers and embedded devices. Known for its stability, flexibility, and security, Linux is widely used by developers, system administrators, and enterprises around the world.

## üåü Key Concepts

- **Kernel:** The core of the operating system, managing hardware, processes, memory, and system calls.
- **Distributions (Distros):** Variants of Linux packaged with different software and tools (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, CentOS).
- **Shell:** Command-line interface for interacting with the system (e.g., bash, zsh).
- **Package Manager:** Tool for installing, updating, and removing software (e.g., apt, yum, pacman).
- **Filesystem Hierarchy:** Standard directory structure for Linux systems.
