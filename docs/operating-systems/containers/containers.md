title: Containers
---

Containers are lightweight, portable units of software that package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring it runs consistently across different computing environments.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Isolation:** Each container runs in its own isolated environment, sharing the host OS kernel.
- **Portability:** Containers can run on any system that supports the container runtime (e.g., Docker), making deployment easy across development, testing, and production.
- **Efficiency:** Containers are more resource-efficient than virtual machines because they share the host OS kernel.

---

## 🚀 Popular Container Technologies

- **Docker:** The most widely used container platform.
- **Podman:** A daemonless container engine compatible with Docker.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestrates and manages containers at scale.
- **LXC/LXD:** System containers for running entire Linux distributions.

## 📝 Notes

- Containers are ideal for microservices architectures.
- Images are the blueprints for containers; they define what’s inside.
- Containers can be managed individually or orchestrated in clusters.
