## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Functions of an Operating System

- **Process Management:** Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Memory Management:** Manages allocation and deallocation of memory space.
- **File System Management:** Organizes, stores, retrieves, and manages data on storage devices.
- **Device Management:** Controls and coordinates input/output devices.
- **Security and Access Control:** Protects data and system resources from unauthorized access.
- **User Interface:** Provides ways for users to interact with the system (CLI, GUI).

## üè∑Ô∏è Types of Operating Systems

- **Batch Operating Systems:** Execute batches of jobs with minimal user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing Operating Systems:** Allow multiple users to use the system interactively at the same time.
- **Distributed Operating Systems:** Manage a group of independent computers and make them appear as a single computer.
- **Embedded Operating Systems:** Designed for embedded devices (e.g., IoT, appliances).
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** Provide immediate processing for time-critical tasks.
- **Mobile Operating Systems:** Designed for mobile devices (e.g., Android, iOS).
