## üß© Key Concepts

- **Algorithms:** Step-by-step procedures for solving problems.
- **Data Structures:** Ways to organize and store data (e.g., arrays, lists, trees, hash tables).
- **Variables:** Named storage for data values.
- **Control Flow:** Directs the order of execution (e.g., if statements, loops).
- **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Organizes code using objects and classes.
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors in code.
- **Version Control:** Tracking and managing changes to code (e.g., Git).
