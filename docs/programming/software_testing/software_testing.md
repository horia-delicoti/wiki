title: Software Testing
---

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system works as intended. It helps identify bugs, ensure quality, and validate that requirements are met before release.

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Bug/Defect:** An error or flaw in software that produces incorrect or unexpected results.
- **Test Case:** A set of conditions or steps used to determine if a feature works correctly.
- **Test Plan:** A document outlining the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.
- **Test Coverage:** The extent to which the code is tested by test cases.
- **Regression Testing:** Re-testing after changes to ensure existing functionality is not broken.
- **Automation Testing:** Using tools to execute tests automatically.

## üß™ Types of Software Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Testing how different components work together.
- **System Testing:** Testing the complete and integrated software system.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Verifying the system meets business requirements (often done by end users).
- **Smoke Testing:** Basic tests to check if the major functions work.
- **Performance Testing:** Assessing speed, responsiveness, and stability under load.
- **Security Testing:** Identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring data protection.
